# Hello World - Windows

The purpose of this repo is to configure and test the required configuration files for the IDE's

I use, for the languages I use, with the latest versions I use, using a minimal "Hello World" program

for each language. There are equivalent repo's for Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and MacOS.
