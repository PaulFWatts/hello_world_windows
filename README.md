# Hello World - Windows

This repo provides a minimal working project, utilising a "Hello World" program, to provide a starter project for the languages and IDE's I use.
Additional Frameworks, Libraries or Stacks can then be added as required.
There are equivalent repo's for Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and MacOS.
